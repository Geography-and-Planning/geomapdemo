## What modules are currently available?
Answer: Currently, there are three modules available. The main one is the geomapdemo module, which is mainly based on ipyleaflet interactive map making. The backup one is the foliumap module, which is mainly based on folium interactive map making. The third one is the chart module, which is used to make interactive charts for GIS Analysis. All three modules are still under development.

For the difference between the two modules, please check the API reference on the [documentation](https://zyang91.github.io/geomapdemo) website.

## Why does the interactive map not show up?
Answer: If the interactive map does not appear on Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab, it is probably because the ipyleaflet extension has not been installed properly. For example, you might receive an error message saying ```Error displaying widget: model not found.``` This a well-known issue related to ipyleaflet. (For example, on the doc website, some examples don't show up)

## Are there any tutorial videos or examples to learn about the package?
